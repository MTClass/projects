## Benin agriculture

Interactive map showing genetic diversity of rice varieties in two ecogeographic regions in BENIN, West Africa, 
and relationship to:
* management and decisions that farmers make on their fields on a daily basis, and
* environmental variables such as rainall, elevation, temperature, etc.
It will also display some touristic characteristics of the country and some points of interests.

### Data

Project repository: https://github.com/nohevog1/Final_Project

## To Do

These are next steps for the project.

#### Documentation

Add the following content to the README.md in your repo.

1. 1 or 2 sentences describing overall project goals, e.g., interactive tool?, hypothesis test? (DONE)
2. Attribution and links to authoritative data sources (0% complete)
https://github.com/umbcvis/projects/tree/master/nohevog1/data
3. Extremely brief description of all pre-processing (0% complete)
    * PB has converted some of the files, and will prepare the others as well.
    * GeoJSON repo: https://github.com/umbcvis/projects/tree/master/nohevog1

#### Technical

For each steps, create a separate gist/block -- link to these in your repo's README.md

1. Plot GeoJSON for any data in this repository -- put it in a gist and link to it from your repo's README.md
2. Add some type of basemap (possibly a slippy map) -- TBD
3. Add interaction other data sources (e.g., images) -- TBD

#### Gist
Version 1
url: https://gist.github.com/nohevog1/65e448364a9057a6b01a6be6405efb76

Version 2
url: https://gist.github.com/nohevog1/56f18c2095fcd145b384cf01147042f7

#### Trying to do
1. Display the different shapefiles
2. Overlay them 
3. Figure out the type of interactions among shapefiles
4. Would like to create an UII to display or not the different elements chosen from a drop-down list
5. Click on a Department or State, and have the different pictures showing and close
6. Make one or 2 graphs
