## Benin agriculture

Interactive map showing genetic diversity of rice varieties in two ecogeographic regions in BENIN, West Africa, 
and relationship to:
* management and decisions that farmers make on their fields on a daily basis, and
* environmental variables such as rainall, elevation, temperature, etc.
It will also display some touristic characteristics of the country and some points of interests.

### Data

Project repository: https://github.com/nohevog1/Final_Project

## To Do

These are next steps for the project.

#### Documentation

Add the following content to the README.md in your repo.

1. 1 or 2 sentences describing overall project goals, e.g., interactive tool?, hypothesis test? (DONE)
2. Attribution and links to authoritative data sources (0% complete)
3. Extremely brief description of all pre-processing (0% complete)
    * PB has converted some of the files, and will prepare the others as well.
    * GeoJSON repo: https://github.com/umbcvis/projects/tree/master/nohevog1

#### Technical

For each steps, create a separate gist/block -- link to these in your repo's README.md

1. Plot GeoJSON for any data in this repository -- put it in a gist and link to it from your repo's README.md
2. Add some type of basemap (possibly a slippy map) -- TBD
3. Add interaction other data sources (e.g., images) -- TBD
