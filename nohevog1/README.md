## Benin agriculture

### Goal

Interactive map showing genetic diversity of rice varieties in two ecogeographic regions in BENIN, West Africa, 
and relationship to:
* management and decisions that farmers make on their fields on a daily basis, and
* environmental variables such as rainall, elevation, temperature, etc.
It will also display some touristic characteristics of the country and some points of interests.

##### Objectives

1. Display the different shapefiles
2. Overlay them 
3. Figure out the type of interactions among shapefiles
4. Would like to create an UII to display or not the different elements chosen from a drop-down list
5. Click on a Department or State, and have the different pictures showing and close
6. Make one or 2 graphs

## To Do

These are next steps for your project.

#### Documentation

Add the following content to the README.md in your project repo.

* Attribution -- Add (to **your** project repository) a sentence describing data source/ownership.
    * *If your data were created as part of another class or program, then reference that class/program*
* Extremely brief description of all pre-processing
    * *Did you create your shapefiles for your other class/program?  If so, what tools did you use?*
    * Shapefiles converted to GeoJSON by instructor: https://github.com/umbcvis/projects/tree/master/nohevog1

#### Technical

1. Slippy map initialized on Benin

    * Change the initial center (line 87) and zoom level (line 96) to center the slippy map on Benin
