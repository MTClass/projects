## Benin agriculture

#### Goal

Goal: Interactive map showing genetic diversity of rice varieties in two ecogeographic regions in BENIN, West Africa, 
and relationship to:
* management and decisions that farmers make on their fields on a daily basis, and
* environmental variables such as rainall, elevation, temperature, etc.
It will also display some touristic characteristics of the country and some points of interests.

#### Implementation 

1. Display the different shapefiles
2. Overlay them 
3. Figure out the type of interactions among shapefiles
4. Would like to create an UII to display or not the different elements chosen from a drop-down list
5. Click on a Department or State, and have the different pictures showing and close
6. Make one or 2 graphs

## To Do

These are next steps for your project.

#### Documentation

Add the following content to the README.md in your project repo.

* Attribution -- Add (to **your** project repository) a sentence describing data source/ownership.
    * *If your data were created as part of another class or program, then reference that class/program*
* Extremely brief description of all pre-processing
    * *Did you create your shapefiles for your other class/program?  If so, what tools did you use?*
    * Shapefiles converted to GeoJSON by instructor: https://github.com/umbcvis/projects/tree/master/nohevog1

#### Technical

For each steps, create a separate gist/block -- link to these in your repo's README.md

1. Plot GeoJSON for any data in this repository -- put it in a gist and link to it from your repo's README.md
2. Add some type of basemap (possibly a slippy map) -- TBD
3. Add interaction other data sources (e.g., images) -- TBD
