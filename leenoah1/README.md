## Anacostia Watershed

### Data

Repo: https://github.com/leenoah1/class_project

## To Do

These are next steps for the project.

#### Documentation

Add the following content to the README.md in your repo.

1. 1 or 2 sentences describing overall project goals
2. Attribution and links to all data sources (including watershed)
3. Extremely brief description of all pre-processing, for example:

        * Converted census.gov shapefile to GeoJSON using an online tool. 
        * Clipped to watershed with GIS tools

#### Technical

Each of these steps should its own gist/block -- link to these in your repo's README.md

1. Plot GeoJSON for clipped GeoJSON -- put it in a gist and link to it from your repo's README.md
2. Plot GeoJSON on top of a slippy map (zoomable map tiles)
3. Add interaction using data in the GeoJSON file
