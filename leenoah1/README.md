## Anacostia Watershed

Population demographics by race for the Anacostia watershed.

### Data

Project repository: https://github.com/leenoah1/class_project

## To Do

These are next steps for the project.

#### Documentation

Add the following content to the README.md in your repo.

1. 1 or 2 sentences describing overall project goals, e.g., interactive tool?, hypothesis test? (50% complete)
2. Attribution and links to all data sources (20% complete)
    * describe parameters used in census.gov API query
    * need source of watershed data
3. Extremely brief description of all pre-processing (0% complete)
    * For example: Converted census.gov shapefile to GeoJSON using an online tool (?? -- add link to tool)
    * Clipped to watershed with GIS tools (?? -- which tools)

#### Technical

For each steps, create a separate gist/block -- link to these in your repo's README.md

1. Plot GeoJSON for clipped GeoJSON -- put it in a gist and link to it from your repo's README.md
2. Plot GeoJSON on top of a slippy map (zoomable map tiles)
3. Add interaction using data in the GeoJSON file
