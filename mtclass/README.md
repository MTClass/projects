## Maryland county

Interactive chloropleth map based on data from census.gov

### Data

Project repository: https://github.com/MTClass/Project

## To Do

Next steps for the project....
1) Draw a circle for Rockville using using the Lat Long
2) Create a drag function for the circle
3) Drag the circle on top of the State, and as the circle moves, it will label the Counties that it is moving over like in Class 13 the States were labelled.
4) Create a stacked bar chart of ACS data (starting with mbostock's stacked bar chart block)

#### Documentation

Add the following content to the README.md in your repo.

1. 1 or 2 sentences describing overall project goals, e.g., interactive tool?, hypothesis test? (0% complete)
Goal is to identify the counties with the greatest population
Chary will show how the population is distributed by age cohorts which will tell the story as to what age cohorts are concentrated in specific Counties, e,g PG County has the largest population ages 20-24, perhaps because of UMD, and Montgomery County seems to attract retirees.

2. Attribution and links to all data sources (5% complete)
Data is from census.gov.  I have used both the decennial census and American Fact Finder.
    * describe parameters used in ACI API query to get county-level data
3. Extremely brief description of all pre-processing, if any (0% complete)
Completed the map with County boundaries.
