2. Attribution and links to all data sources (0% complete)
    * describe parameters used in census.gov API query
3. Extremely brief description of all pre-processing (0% complete)

#### Technical

For each steps, create a separate gist/block -- link to these in your repo's README.md

1. Plot Topo/GeoJSON for region of interest.
    * Template block from Mick Bostock -- https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060606
2. Integrate census data
    * Will need to adapt the template to CSV data
    * The template block loads population data (CSV) using d3map()
    * Identify in detail what is going on with d3.map in the example
    * Create a simple example (start by using something that can be manipulated in console)
3. Add interaction somehow (TBD)
